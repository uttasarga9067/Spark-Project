#Spark Project
1. The Location of the Data used in this project is present at a certain given Location.
2. Use the same location of the data in the Python script in order to clean the unstructured Data.
3. The File Temp_Test.html consists of step-by-step process to clean the Weather Data for 9 years(2010-2019)
4. After Cleaning the Data for each year, Design Spark SQL commands in order to perform the Tasks listed below:
(1) Find the hottest and the coldest day accross all years along with the station code and date.
(2) Find the hottest and the coldest day of each year; along with the station code and date.
(3) Find the Maximum and Minimum Precipitation with the station code and date for the year 2015(You Can find the same by changing just the     Year in the SQL Query attached for the third task)
(4) Measure the percentage of the values which are missing in STP(Mean Station Pressure) along with the station code for each year.
(5) Find the station code with the maximum wind gust for each year.
5. I am also attaching the PySpark SQL queries along with the Output of each in order to get a good idea of the functionality of the code and the whole dataset.
